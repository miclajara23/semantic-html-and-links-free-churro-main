    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>American possums, also known as opossums, are truly one-of-a-kind creatures that are sure to amaze any animal
      lover. These marsupials are native to North America and are known for their unique appearance, with pointed
      snouts, long tails, and the ability to hang upside down by their tail. American possums may be small, with an
      average weight of around 5 pounds, but they are mighty in their own way.</p>

    <p>But there's more to these animals than just their cute and cuddly appearance. American possums are nocturnal
      creatures that are omnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of plants and animals including insects, fruits,
      vegetables, and even small vertebrates. They are also masters of survival, with the ability to "play dead" or
      "feign death" when threatened, a defense mechanism that helps them avoid predators. Despite their sometimes fierce
      appearance, American possums are generally timid and non-aggressive animals. They are also important members of
      their ecosystem, helping to control pest populations and disperse the seeds of various plants.</p>
